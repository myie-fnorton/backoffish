# backoffish
Potted api responses for training and demo purposes.

Access via https://min.gitcdn.link/, eg

access https://raw.githubusercontent.com/myie-fnorton/backoffish/master/api/accountsList.json 
as https://gitcdn.link/repo/myie-fnorton/backoffish/master/api/accountsList.json


nb: there's a redirect in the gitcdn.link response, so you want to do something like:
 curl -J -L https://gitcdn.link/repo/myie-fnorton/backoffish/master/api/accountsList.json
if you want to do it from the Bash command line.
